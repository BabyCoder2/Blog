    <h1>Journey Into Tech</h1>
    <a href="about.html">About Me</a>
    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Jasmine and I am a lover of Christ. I currently
        live in Nashville, TN with my 2 sons. Currently I am a coin room
        operator for Brinks. At the moment I am learning frontend development from Frontend Masters as I am looking to
        change careers to become a frontend developer.

    <p>Majority of the jobs I have worked have been in the fields of customer serivce: retail or call center and
        warehouse.
        These jobs don't pay well and often times you are over worked and underappreciated. I knew I was ready for a
        career
        shift when I worked for a call center back in 2021. I searched for tech jobs and summed it down to non phone
        tech jobs.
        Thats how I came across web devlopment.
    </p>
    <p>Every since Oct 2021 I have been on countless searches and paying for courses to break into tech and nothing has
        worked. I either became discouraged or when an opportuinity did come I sabbotaged it myself by not stewarding
        that opportuinity well. But now, 3 years later I feel I have come to the final stage of my web development
        journey where I have found a reliable source to get me to my goal of becoming a frontend developer thanks to
        Frontend Masters.

    <h1>Why Frontend?</h1>

    <p>Why not frontend?</p>
    <p>I have come across so many different types of developers and frontend was the only thing that sparked an interest
        in me.
        Besides, I've never been in a field where I was able to create something. To me, a frontend developer is low key
        like a
        digital artist. The way in which you put different syntax, tags and etc together for it to produce something
        beautiful
        in the end. Why not frontend? It seems so straightforward to me. Though it can be challenging but it's one of
        those
        challenges that keeps me interested but curious.

    <p>There is no way in hell in my 60's will I be looking for another job. That really had me thinking today as we had
        a new hire and she is in her 60s. NO. FREAKING. WAY. The only reason I would see myself working is if I am
        working
        for my own business but than that wouldnt even seem or feel like working as I know I would be doing something
        meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>In order for that to not happen. It is imperative that now at 34 that I am being intentional about all aspects of
        my life but that I am also stearding the things that GOD has given me well.

    <h1>Learning Journey</h1>
    <h3>Jasmine Amos</h3>

    <p>My learning journey the past 3 years has been a roll coaster ride. One moment I think I have found a great
        channel
        on YouTube that could teach me what I need to know, only to be confused by the pleothora of others who are
        teaching
        what I am trying to learn. It doesn't help that you have those 'tech influencers' who seem to be fear mongering
        and
        making videos that make you question rather or not if this is what you truly want to do. I have wasted
        money on courses that are still unfinished or cancelled the subscription because I wasnt engaged in the content.
    </p>
    <p>I really had to ask myself is this something that I truly wanted to do? Why do I want to do this first of all? In
        the beginning, it had to do everything about money. Until time has gone by that the money is a plus it's the
        fact
        that I will be doing something that I have never done before. It is an ever evolving field where I will be
        constantly
        learning. If you think about it, as we live we are forever students. Constantly evolvoing and learning just to
        be able
        to navigate life. Most jobs I hit this phase where I get bored and don't feel the least bit challenged and I am
        ready
        to leave.
    </p>
    <p>The moment I came across Frontend Masters I was like ok this might actually be it. I managed to shy away from
        learning
        and still looking at countless videos on YT to only be in what they call tuturiol hell and always still on html.
        smh
        So I gave it another shot after receiving an email about the first month being a discount. So I took the dive
        and
        now I have completed the first project of the course which is this html blog. I have to say, so far Frontend
        Masters
        gives
        me college vibes but I love it.

    <p>Just sitting here typing up this html blog in VS Code really has my brain a turning as I have soooo
        many questions. I feel like a little kid which I can really say this is nuturing my inner child right now. lol
    </p>
    <p>I tell you this: You deserve to be in any space you have interest in and never let anybody tell you different.
        Stay encouraged, stay curious. Happy coding.

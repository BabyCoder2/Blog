    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my blog. My name is Jasmine and I am a lover of Christ. I currently
        live in Nashville, TN with my 2 sons. Currently I am a coin room
        operator for Brinks. At the moment I am learning frontend development from Frontend Masters as I am looking to
        change careers
        to become a frontend developer.

    <p>Majority of the jobs I have worked have been in the fields of customer serivce: retail or call center and
        warehouse.
        These jobs don't pay well and often times you are over worked and underappreciated. I knew I was ready for a
        career
        shift when I worked for a call center back in 2021. I searched for tech jobs and summed it down to non phone
        tech jobs.
        Thats how I came across web devlopment.
    </p>
    <p>Every since Oct 2021 I have been on countless searches and paying for courses to break into tech and nothing has
        worked. I either became discouraged or when an opportuinity did come I sabbotaged it myself by not stewarding
        that opportuinity well. But now, 3 years later I feel I have come to the final stage of my web development
        journey where I have found a reliable source to get me to my goal of becoming a frontend developer thanks to
        Frontend Masters.

    <h1>Why Frontend?</h1>

    <p>Why not frontend?</p>
    <p>I have come across so many different types of developers and frontend was the only thing that sparked an interest
        in me.
        Besides, I've never been in a field where I was able to create something. To me, a frontend developer is low key
        like a
        digital artist. The way in which you put different syntax, tags and etc together for it to produce something
        beautiful
        in the end. Why not frontend? It seems so straightforward to me. Though it can be challenging but it's one of
        those
        challenges that keeps me interested but curious.

    <p>There is no way in hell in my 60's will I be looking for another job. That really had me thinking today as we had
        a new hire and she is in her 60s. NO. FREAKING. WAY. The only reason I would see myself working is if I am
        working
        for my own business but than that wouldnt even seem or feel like working as I know I would be doing something
        meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>In order for that to not happen. It is imperative that now at 34 that I am being intentional about all aspects of
        my life but that I am also stearding the things that GOD has given me well.
